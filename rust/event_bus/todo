- [x] implement event acceptor
- [x] run event acceptor in a separate thread
- [x] implement logging
- [x] parse source events
- [ ] explore using serde for parsing
- [?] close connections when done
- [ ] implement client acceptor
- [ ] implement concurrent processing (processing log partitioning)
- [ ] limit number of concurrently connected users
- [ ] convert the code to async-std
- [ ] read configuration from environment variables
- [ ] compare whole results
- [ ] avoid copying data (make Event a view into raw string)
- [ ] figure out why `std::result::Result<usize, std::boxed::Box<dyn std::error::Error>>` does not implement `PartialEq`
